## Why Quizical
If you ever want to sit back and relax and see how smart you are, look no further. The reason why Quizical is a great place to show off your skills is because it records all of your quiz results. This is what makes Quizical such a fun place to be. You will know the areas you struggle in, as well as the areas you are dominant in. Our first priority is to be a place to go to have fun, but we will also allow users to grow their understanding of various topics by giving them their stats on quizzes they have previously taken. What are you waiting for? Go see how awesome you are!

## What is Quizical
Quizical is a very simple app that allows users to take quizzes on various topics. With the click of a button, the user will be given 10 questions on the topic of their choosing. The great thing about Quizical is how similar it is to a written quiz. You submit all your answers at once, not one at a time. The answer you select will light up green, but you are able to change your answer before you hit the submit button. After you hit submit, you will be given your score, as well as all of the correct answers. We want users not only to take quizzes, but be able to learn from questions they didn’t get correctly. The best feature of Quizical in my opinion is the User History. With the click of a button, the user can see how they perform on each category. It will show you your percentage, as well as the total amount of correctly answered questions. This is what will bring users back to Quizical. Everyone will want to improve their stats on every subject available.
